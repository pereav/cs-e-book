Keyboard Processing with Control Flow
Chapter 11
Objectives 
	1) Discover the assembly language tools that are used for control and logic flow.
	2) Make use of LOOP, CMP, JMP, and unconditional jump instruction in assembly language program.
	3) Be aware of the usefulness of representing the logic of the program

STRING INPUT
The following instruction wait for the input string, pressing ENTER key and the input string is stored to a specified identifier namely x.

@code snippet(naka-box)
	MOV AH,	0Ah						; request for string input
	MOV DX, OFFSET X 				; load address
	INT 21h
@end

But before you apply instructions to accept string, you have to define the identifier to hold the input string.

Format: 

@code snipper(naka-box)
	<identifier> DB <max-size-str>, <current-size>, <max-size-str> DUP ("$")
@end

Where : 
<max-size-str>			- numeric constant defining the maximum number of characters minus three (3).

<current-size>			- declared as question mark (?) meaning undefined. It will have a value after the input. It holds the number of characters entered.

DUP("$")				- fills the string with dollar symbol.

Example :
			NEYM DB 08h, ? 08h DUP ("$")

In the above example, it means that the maximum size of string you can enter is 8 08h minus . Thus, the required number of characters to be entered is only 5 instead of 8. Why only 5 and not 8? You can only input 5 characters because 08h will be stored in the first memory address. If your input is 'vale', there are 4 characters, 04h will be stored in the second memory address, charater 'v' will be stored in the third location, 'a' in the fourth, and so on and so forth. After pressing ENTER key, 0Dh will be stored at the last memory address.
To illustrate :

---------------------------------------------------------------------
|	08h	| 	04h	  |   v   | 	a 	| 	l 	| 	e 	|   $ 	| 0Dh	|
---------------------------------------------------------------------

DSIPLAYING THE INPUT STRING
The following instruction display the input string starting at the third memory address :

@code snippet(naka-box)
	MOV AH,	09h						; request for string input
	MOV DX, OFFSET X + 2 				
	INT 21h
@end

<b>Sample Program that demonstrates string input and displays it again on screen</b>

			A1	 DB		0Ah, 0Dh, "What a nice name! $"
			A2	 DB		0Ah, 0Dh, "I'm glad to meet you! $"

	.CODE
	start :
			MOV AX, @DATA
			MOV DS, AX

			MOV AH,	09h						
			MOV DX, OFFSET Q				
			INT 21h

			MOV AH,	0Ah						; request for string input

			MOV DX, OFFSET NEYM + 2
