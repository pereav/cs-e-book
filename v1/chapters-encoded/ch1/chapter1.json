		"title": "Number System",
		"content": "It is a way of counting things and identifying the quantity of something. Likewise, number system refers to the set of symbols used to express quantities as the basis for counting, determining order, comparing amounts, performing calculations, and representing value. It is the set of characters and mathematical rules that are used to represent a digit. Examples include the Arabic, Babylonian, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Mayan, and Roman number systems. The ISBN and Dewey Decimal System are examples of number systems used in libraries. Even Social Security System has a number system of its own."

	    "content": "It is also called as the <span class=\"bold italic\">radix</span>. Base refers to the number of digits (basic symbols) in a number system. A subcript attached to a number indicates the base radix of that number. 100 (base 2) means 100 (read as one-zero-one), on the other hand, 100 (base 10) means decimal 100 (read as one hundred) subscripts help classify equations where different number systems are combined."
